3.2.4: bug fixed in odd-even management in CTF correction
3.2.3: declare requirements.txt in manifest
3.2.2:
  - Add requirements
3.2.1:
  - Fixing a bug with odd even in tomogram reconstruction
  - Tolerating errors in alignment
  - Making tomogram reconstruction error tolerant
  - Making tilt series alignment error tolerant
  - Adding possible outputs in xray eraser
  - Removing visible parameters with the intepolation is not applied
3.2.0:
  - add more possible outputs
  - fixing ctf after aretomo
  - make ctf auomatic estimation tolerant to errors
  - odd/even processing implemented
  - update FiducialModel
  - changes in protocols to save if landmark model has residual information
  - fix: interpolated flag is no set when correcting the CTFs
  - user-controllable binning for display in 3dmod: plugin variable -> IMOD_VIEWER_BINNING = 1
3.1.10:
  - fix DefocusTol param type for CTF correction protocol: must be integer
  - fix binning for other protocols
3.1.9:
  - fix binning for normalization protocols
  - fix excluded views parsing
3.1.8:
  - Reconstruction:
     - tomoWidth added to specify a width when reconstructing
     - Shift in Z is registered in tomogram origin

  - Ctf correction: Allows different size of ctf set and ts set. Only paired (TS-CTF) ones will be processed
3.1.7:
  - Validate input alignment for TS preprocess protocol
  - Fix: Xray eraser when there is alignment.
3.1.6:
  icon added
  template added for automatic tilt series alignment
3.1.5: fix xf file reading, add IMOD 4.11.24, remove previous binaries as they are gone fron the website
3.1.4: set tilt axis to 0 if TS is aligned (reported by Bram Koster)
3.1.3: fix installation: remove libjpeg62 check
3.1.2:
  - Flag ts as interpolated in some cases
  - Imod protocols do not work, for now in streaming
3.1:
  - remove displayAll button from set viewer as it seems to be not practical to open all items at once (close #141)
  - change etomo naming style to mrc (close #153)
  - output xtilt file from fid alignment
  - rename fid alignment output to align.log and parse it with imod tools
  - add beadtrack step  with current model as seed (close #160)
  - refactor viewers:
     - remove ImodSetOfLandmarkModelsView, ImodSetOfTomogramsView, ImodSetView
     - remove displayAllButton
     - update etomoviewer for new naming style
     - show tilt angles in 3dmod viewer (close #161 )
     - fix saved3DCoord etomo output display
  - fix rotation angle calculation for newstack operation
  - remove transformation step from imod ctf estimation (ctf is estimated on raw ts stack)
  - fix rotation angle range for swapping x/y for newstack
  - do not copy objId for apply TM protocol when excluding views
  - fix output size in apply TM protocol
  - fix wrong output file index numbers in the exclude views protocol
  - fix gold erasing option in the fid. alignment protocol
  - fix generating ctf output; hide some params from manual ctf protocol; do not run autofit for manual protocol
  - added xform file to ctfphaseflip to rotate astigmatism estimation and adjust for x  -shifts for the image center
  - fix excluded views parsing from com files
  - rename "normalization" to "preprocess" protocols
  - handle excluded views properly (closes #137 , closes #147)
  - ctfplotter handles excluded views properly, output ctfs for such views have 0 values
  - fix failed ts generation in fid.alignment protocol
  - pep8 fixes, add pip  -related files
  - mtffilter was missing pixelsize param, causing wrong filter being applied (always with 1A/px)
  - add antialias param to ts norm protocol
  - fix wrong default naming style for etomo
  - enable robust fitting for beadtracker
  - remove redundant updateDim calls
  - get acquisition from ts when creating a tomo
  - fix pixsize and dims for etomo outputs (closes #139)
  - fix beadtrack args to match copytomocoms script
  - always use antialias when binning a stack
  - two surfaces search is off in both protocols for consistency
  - bead radius default is 18px (good range for bin 4 and 10nm beads)
  - use sobel filter for bead centering for most cryo data
  - use lowpass for bead tracking
  - use adjustbeadsizes
  - trimvol -yz replaced by -rx, the first one flips the hand
  - add expandcircles to eraser
  - replace wrong dose file format for mtffilter
  - set output 3D coord size based on bead diameter
  - fix betterradius param in gold eraser tab of the fid alignment
  - add missing pix size in fid align
  - fix minpacing in gold picker
  - add missing taper arg for newstack
